## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
This project demonstrates advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques using Pandas and Scikit-learn. The goal is to prepare a raw marketing dataset for downstream machine learning tasks, forming a crucial part of a broader data science pipeline.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

Imputed or handled missing values appropriately

## âœ… Feature Engineering
Engineered a new feature: customer_days (number of days since enrollment)

Dropped non-informative or redundant fields:

id, dt_customer, z_costcontact, z_revenue

## âœ… Data Export
